# bootstrap4jekyll
Adds the 
[Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
framework to your _Jekyll_ site.

Although the
[Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
framework exists as a GEM, called [bootstrap rubygem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap),
it cannot be used directly in a _Jekyll_ site, because it is specifically made for _rails_.

_bootstrap4jekyll_ acts as an intermediate between the original
[bootstrap rubygem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap)
and _Jekyll_. Thus making [bootstrap rubygem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap) 
available to _Jekyll_ programmers.

This gem is inspired by the 
[jekyll-bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-bootstrap-sass) GEM,
which has not been maintained the last four years.
