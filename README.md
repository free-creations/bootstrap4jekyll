# bootstrap4jekyll
Adds the Twitter Bootstrap framework to your Jekyll site.

The Twitter Bootstrap framework exists as a gem and is called [bootstrap rubygem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap)

_Jekyll_ programmers cannot directly use this gem because it is specifically made for _rails_.

_bootstrap4jekyll_ akts as an intermediate between the original
[bootstrap rubygem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap)
and _Jekyll_. Thus making [bootstrap rubygem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap) to _Jekyll_ programmers.

This gem is inspired by the 
[jekyll-bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-bootstrap-sass) gem,
which has not been maintained the last four years.
